COVID-19 Tweet Hub: CMSC 495 Group 6 Project
========================================

This repository contains the final project for Group 6 which is an app that gets tweets about 
COVID-19 from twitter accounts and loads it into a table.  You can run this example
code locally, or deploy it to Heroku for free to see how it runs in a
production-style environment.

You can check out our deployment with keys at:
https://umuccmsc495g6project.herokuapp.com/

Heroku Installation
```````````````````
`Heroku`_ is a great way to get up and running fast, and you don't even need
to open the terminal!

Step 1: Deploy to Heroku
------------------------
It's easy, and it's free! Just click on this button:

|heroku-deploy|

You can leave all the fields at their default values: we'll fill them in later.
The only thing that matters right now is the app name, and Heroku will
autogenerate a name for you if you leave that field blank. Using an
autogenerated name is perfectly fine, just take note of what it is.

Note that your app isn't functional yet, and if you try to visit it right now,
you'll end up at a 500 internal error page. That's OK, we're not done yet!

Step 2: Get OAuth credentials from Twitter
------------------------------------------
Visit https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps to register an
app on Twitter. In order to register the application, you'll need that
app name from Heroku. 

Once you've registered your application on Twitter, Twitter will give you an
app ID and app secret, which we'll use in the next step.

Step 3: Give OAuth credentials to your app on Heroku
----------------------------------------------------
Go to Heroku and visit the settings page for your app. (You can get there from
your Heroku dashboard, or by clicking on the "Manage App" button after the
deploy step is finished.) On that page, there should be a section called
"Config Variables" where you can manage the config vars for your application.
You'll need click the "Reveal Config Vars" button to see which variables
are available, and then the "Edit" button to allow you to change these variables.

Take the app ID you got from Twitter, and paste it into the "VALUE" field
next to the ``TWITTER_OAUTH_CLIENT_KEY`` field, replacing the dummy value that
was there before. Similarly, take the app secret you got from Twitter,
and paste it into the "VALUE" field next to the ``TWITTER_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET``
field, replacing the dummy value that was there before.
Click the "Save" button when you're done.

Step 4: Visit your app 
----------------------------------------------
Your app name from Heroku will determine the URL that your app is running on:
the URL will be ``https://APPNAME.herokuapp.com``. For example, if Heroku
assigned you an app name of ``dingleberry``, your app will be available at
``https://dingleberry.herokuapp.com``. Visit that URL, and you should
immediately be redirected to login with Twitter!

Local Installation
``````````````````
If you'd prefer to run this locally on your computer, you can do that as well.

Step 1: Get OAuth credentials from Twitter
------------------------------------------
Visit https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps to register an
app on Twitter. 

Once you've registered your application on Twitter, Twitter will give you an
app ID and app secret, which we'll use in step 3.

Step 2: Install code and dependencies
-------------------------------------
Run the following commands on your computer::

    git clone https://github.com/dannypenguin/CMSC495G6
    cd CMSC495G6
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

These commands will clone this git repository onto your computer,
create a `virtual environment`_ for this project, activate it, and install
the dependencies listed in ``requirements.txt``.

Step 3: Set environment variables
---------------------------------
Many applications use `environment variables`_ for configuration. You'll need to set the following environment
variables:

* ``TWITTER_OAUTH_CLIENT_KEY``: set this to the app ID you got from Twitter.
* ``TWITTER_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET``: set this to the app secret you got
  from Twitter.
* ``OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT``: set this to ``true``. This indicates that
  you're doing local testing, and it's OK to use HTTP instead of HTTPS for
  OAuth. You should only do this for local testing.
  Do **not** set this in production! [`oauthlib docs`_]


Step 4: Run your app 
--------------------------------------------
If you're setting environment variables manually, run your app using Python::

    FLASK_APP=app.py flask run


Then, go to http://localhost:5000/ to visit your app!
